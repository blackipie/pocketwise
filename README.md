<br><br>
Pocketwise is a comprehensive money management application that helps individuals,
groups, and families keep track of their income, expenses, and debts. With its user-friendly
interface and intuitive features, Pocketwise simplifies financial management, saving time and
reducing stress.
<br><br>
The application consists of three sections: My Pockets, Shared Expense, and Helping Pocket.
My Pockets allows individuals to create pockets that represent their income, expenses, and
savings. Each pocket displays the user's income, current balance after expenses, and total
expenses. Users can add expenses with location, date, and time and then view the total
expenses calculated by the application. The expenses can be edited or deleted as required.
Shared Expense is designed for groups of people sharing a rental room or apartment, where
calculating expenses for rent, utilities, and groceries can be a hassle. With Shared Expense,
group members can add their expenses, and the application calculates and shows a report
indicating whose expense is less and who needs to pay more. The application allows each
member to edit their own expenses in case of any mistakes. The report helps members settle
debts and maintain a clear record of transactions.
<br><br>
Helping Pocket is a unique feature of Pocketwise, which allows group members to add a
certain amount of money every month to a pool, which is managed by one of the members of
the group. The manager is responsible for collecting the money every month, and any
member can send money to the pool at any time. The manager can also lend money to group
members in case of emergency, and the member can repay the debt with a penalty fee if they
miss the due date.
<br><br>
Pocketwise supports three languages, English, Hindi, and Bengali, making it accessible to
users from various backgrounds. It is built using modern technologies such as React,
Node.js, and MongoDB, which ensures that the application is fast, reliable, and scalable.
Additionally, Firebase Cloud Messaging is used for push notifications, ensuring that users
stay up-to-date with their expenses and payments.
Overall, Pocketwise is an essential tool for anyone looking to manage their finances
effectively. Its features, combined with the latest technologies, make it an indispensable
application for individuals, groups, and families who want to keep their financial affairs in
order.

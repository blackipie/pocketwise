# Pocketwise - Synopsis

### Introduction:
<div>

Pocketwise is a comprehensive money management application that helps individuals,
groups, and families keep track of their income, expenses, and debts. With its user-friendly
interface and intuitive features, Pocketwise simplifies financial management, saving time and
reducing stress.
<br><br>
The application consists of three sections: My Pockets, Shared Expense, and Helping Pocket.
My Pockets allows individuals to create pockets that represent their income, expenses, and
savings. Each pocket displays the user's income, current balance after expenses, and total
expenses. Users can add expenses with location, date, and time and then view the total
expenses calculated by the application. The expenses can be edited or deleted as required.
Shared Expense is designed for groups of people sharing a rental room or apartment, where
calculating expenses for rent, utilities, and groceries can be a hassle. With Shared Expense,
group members can add their expenses, and the application calculates and shows a report
indicating whose expense is less and who needs to pay more. The application allows each
member to edit their own expenses in case of any mistakes. The report helps members settle
debts and maintain a clear record of transactions.
<br><br>
Helping Pocket is a unique feature of Pocketwise, which allows group members to add a
certain amount of money every month to a pool, which is managed by one of the members of
the group. The manager is responsible for collecting the money every month, and any
member can send money to the pool at any time. The manager can also lend money to group
members in case of emergency, and the member can repay the debt with a penalty fee if they
miss the due date.
<br><br>
Pocketwise supports three languages, English, Hindi, and Bengali, making it accessible to
users from various backgrounds. It is built using modern technologies such as React,
Node.js, and MongoDB, which ensures that the application is fast, reliable, and scalable.
Additionally, Firebase Cloud Messaging is used for push notifications, ensuring that users
stay up-to-date with their expenses and payments.
Overall, Pocketwise is an essential tool for anyone looking to manage their finances
effectively. Its features, combined with the latest technologies, make it an indispensable
application for individuals, groups, and families who want to keep their financial affairs in
order.

### Problem Statement:

Despite the availability of various personal finance management applications, the existing
solutions lack certain features that Pocketwise aims to address. Cho and Cho (2016)
developed a mobile app for expense tracking and financial planning, but it does not include
features like shared expense management and an emergency fund. Raza and Rahman (2017)
studied the current state and future challenges of mobile personal finance management but
did not propose a new solution. Shukla and Shukla (2018) developed a smart mobile
application for personal finance management, but it lacks features like a helping pocket for
group members.

Similarly, Xu and Xu (2016) designed and implemented a personal finance management
application for mobile devices, but it does not include the feature of Shared expense
management. Bae and Lee (2019) designed a personal finance management application for
youth, but it does not provide the option for shared expense management or an emergency
fund.

Therefore, Pocketwise is designed to overcome the limitations of existing solutions by
providing the features of shared expense management, an emergency fund, and a helping
pocket for group members. It will help individuals and groups to manage their finances
efficiently, without the need for multiple applications.

The My Pockets section of Pocketwise will help individuals track their expenses and manage
their finances effectively. They can create pockets to categorize their expenses and keep track
of their income, expenses, and current amount after expenses. The Shared Expense section
will allow group members to manage their shared expenses efficiently by providing them
with a platform to add their expenses and calculate the amount to be paid by each member.
The Helping Pocket section will enable group members to contribute a certain amount of
money every month and use it in case of emergency.

Pocketwise will be developed using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and will support
three languages: English, Hindi, and Bengali. The use of Firebase Cloud Messaging for
notifications will ensure that users are informed about any new transactions or updates. With
its unique features and ease of use, Pocketwise is set to revolutionize personal finance
management and solve the problems that the previous solutions have not been able to
address.


### Hypothesis:
If users are provided with a user-friendly mobile application that offers a comprehensive
solution for managing personal and shared expenses, they will be more likely to have better
control over their finances and reduce their financial stress.

### Methodology:

The methodology for the development of Pocketwise will follow a structured and iterative
approach, comprising of the following steps:

1.	Requirement Gathering: The first step will be to gather all the requirements of the
project by conducting interviews with stakeholders, analysing existing systems, and
researching industry best practices.

2.	Design: Based on the gathered requirements, a comprehensive design will be created
for the system, including database schema, user interface design, and system
architecture.

3.	Development: Using the design as a blueprint, the development team will start
implementing the system using the chosen technologies, which include React Native,
Nodejs, and MongoDB.

4.	Testing: Once the development is complete, the system will undergo rigorous testing
to ensure that it is functioning as intended and meets all the requirements.

5.	Deployment: After successful testing, the system will be deployed on the production
server and made available for use by end-users.

6.	Maintenance: The system will require ongoing maintenance to ensure its smooth
operation, which will involve monitoring, bug fixing, and upgrades to keep up with
technological advancements.

Throughout the development process, Agile methodology will be followed to ensure that the
project stays on track, any changes or issues are addressed promptly, and the project is
delivered on time and within budget.



### Expected Outcome:

The expected outcome of the "Pocketwise" project is to develop a user-friendly mobile
application that helps users manage their finances effectively. The app will provide features
like creating pockets, adding expenses with location and time, calculating total expenses, and
generating reports. It will also have a shared expense section that allows a group of members
staying in the same rented room to add their expenses and calculate the expenses of the
group. Additionally, the app will have a helping pocket section, where the group members
can contribute a certain amount of money every month and request for emergency money
when needed.

The expected outcome is to deliver a robust and scalable application that helps users manage
their finances and expenses efficiently. It is anticipated that Pocketwise will be widely
adopted by individuals and groups as a tool to manage their finances effectively, and thus,
make a significant impact on financial literacy and management.
